* Dependencies

lisp-jabber has a couple of dependencies.  First, you need ASDF to put
all the pieces together.  See http://www.cliki.net/asdf for details;
basically, you make your Lisp load ASDF every time it starts, push a
directory of your choice onto asdf:*central-registry*, and symlink
all *.asd files into that directory.

Unless you use CLISP or SBCL, lisp-jabber uses CLOCC-PORT for
networking.  The version found at http://clocc.sf.net uses
mk-defsystem instead of ASDF, so get the Debian version from
http://packages.debian.org/cl-port instead.

You need XMLS (see http://www.cliki.net/xmls), along with a patch for
parsing only start tags.  This version is available in Arch archive
mange@freemail.hu--2005/xmls--devo--1.2 (see below).

You need SB-SHA1 (see http://www.cliki.net/sb-sha1).  It can be
installed with ASDF-INSTALL.

You need CL-BASE64 (see http://www.cliki.net/cl-base64).  It can be
installed with ASDF-INSTALL.

If you want to use the client part of lisp-jabber, you need the SASL
library in mange@freemail.hu--2005/cl-sasl--devo--0.1.

When you have installed all this, you can type in the REPL:

(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :jabber-component)
or
(asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op :jabber-client)

which should compile and load the respective part of lisp-jabber along
with all dependencies.
